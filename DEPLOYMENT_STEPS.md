## **Why This Happens**
- The code is likely doing something like:
  ```js
  document.getElementById('selectedDate').value = '';
  ```
  but the element with id `selectedDate` is not present in the DOM (possibly because the form was reset, re-rendered, or never rendered).

---

## **How to Fix**

**Always check if the element exists before setting its value:**
```js
const selectedDateInput = document.getElementById('selectedDate');
if (selectedDateInput) selectedDateInput.value = '';
```
Do the same for `selectedSlot` or any other element you set `.value` on.

---

## **Where to Apply This**
- In your booking form submit handler (after `form.reset()`).
- In your date change handler (when resetting slot selection).

---

## **Example Fix in Context**
Replace:
```js
document.getElementById('selectedDate').value = '';
document.getElementById('selectedSlot').value = '';
```
with:
```js
const selectedDateInput = document.getElementById('selectedDate');
const selectedSlotInput = document.getElementById('selectedSlot');
if (selectedDateInput) selectedDateInput.value = '';
if (selectedSlotInput) selectedSlotInput.value = '';
```

## **Summary Table**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'value') | Element not in DOM | Check if element exists before setting `.value` |

**If you want, I can update your code for you‚Äîjust let me know!**  
This will permanently fix the error and make your

## 1. **Error booking appointment. Please try again.**
- **Supabase 400 (Bad Request):**
  ```
  POST https://tlyjqvknvifpsecpptao.supabase.co/rest/v1/appointments 400 (Bad Request)
  ```
  This means your frontend is sending a request to insert a booking, but Supabase is rejecting it because the data is not valid for the table schema.

---

### **How to Debug and Fix**

#### **A. Check Your Table Schema**
- Make sure your `appointments` table has **all the columns** your code is trying to insert:
  - `name` (text)
  - `phone` (text)
  - `email` (text)
  - `package` (text)
  - `date` (date)
  - `slot` (text)
  - `message` (text, nullable)
  - (optional) `id` (uuid, primary key, default: uuid_generate_v4())
  - (optional) `created_at` (timestamp, default: now())

#### **B. Check Data Types**
- Make sure the types match:
  - `date` should be a real date (e.g., `2024-06-12`), not a string like "June 12th".

#### **C. Check for Required Fields**
- If any field is `NOT NULL` in your table, you must provide a value for it.

#### **D. Check for Extra/Missing Fields**
- If your code sends a field that doesn‚Äôt exist in the table, or omits a required one, you‚Äôll get a 400 error.

#### **E. Check RLS Policies**
- You already fixed the `WITH CHECK` policy, but make sure it‚Äôs enabled and correct.

## 2. **Thank you for your inquiry! We will contact you soon to confirm your appointment.**
- This message should only show on success.  
- Make sure you only show it if the Supabase insert does **not** return an error.

---

## 3. **net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED**
- Your computer lost internet connection.  
- Reconnect and refresh the page.

---

## **Action Steps**

1. **Check your Supabase table schema** and make sure it matches the fields your code is sending.
2. **Check your browser‚Äôs network tab** for the exact request payload and Supabase‚Äôs error message (it will say which field is missing or wrong).
3. **Fix your frontend code** to match the schema exactly.

---

### **Example: Table Creation SQL**

```sql
create table appointments (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  name text not null,
  phone text not null,
  email text not null,
  package text not null,
  date date not null,
  slot text not null,
  message text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```

---

### **Example: Insert Code**

```js
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

---

**If you want, paste the full error message from the Supabase response (not just 400), and I‚Äôll tell you exactly what‚Äôs wrong!**  
Or, let me know if you want to see the exact SQL and code for your use case. 

---

To ensure your website's booking form stores data in Supabase without errors, follow these steps:

---

## 1. **Check Your Supabase Table Schema**

Your `appointments` table **must** have these columns (with correct types):

```sql
create table appointments (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  name text not null,
  phone text not null,
  email text not null,
  package text not null,
  date date not null,
  slot text not null,
  message text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```
- If you have any extra or missing columns, or wrong types, update your table accordingly.

---

## 2. **Check Row Level Security (RLS) Policy**

You must have this policy for inserts:

```sql
create policy "Allow insert for all" on appointments
  for insert
  with check (true);
```
- Make sure RLS is enabled for the table.

---

## 3. **Check Your Frontend Insert Code**

Your code should send **exactly** these fields (no more, no less):

```js
const { error } = await supabase.from('appointments').insert({
  name, phone, email, package: pkg, date, slot, message
});
```
- `date` must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2024-06-12`).
- All fields except `message` must be non-empty.

---

## 4. **Handle Errors and Success Properly**

Only show the "Thank you" message if `error` is falsy:

```js
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

---

## 5. **Debugging a 400 Error**

- Open your browser‚Äôs network tab.
- Click the failed POST request to Supabase.
- Look at the response body for a detailed error message (e.g., "column 'package' does not exist", "date is not a valid date", etc.).
- Fix your code or table to match.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Table | Columns and types match code |
| RLS   | Insert policy with `with check (true)` |
| Code  | Sends only required fields, correct types |
| Error | Only show success message if no error |

---

**If you want, paste the full error message from the Supabase response (not just 400), and I‚Äôll tell you exactly what‚Äôs wrong!**  
Once you fix the schema and policy, your bookings will be stored in the database as expected. 

---

Your RLS policies are correct. The issue is almost certainly a schema or data mismatch.  
Let me know the exact error message from the Supabase response for a precise fix!
